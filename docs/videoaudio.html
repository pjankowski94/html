<h3><p>The main difference between the youtube video file and the uploaded video file is that the youtube video file only 
        requires the user to copy and paste the embed html code. That html code is located within the youtube page of the video link, 
        which is then needed to be pasted into the website.
        With the "Robert goes down" video, more work had to be done in order to achieve the same result. 
        Firstly you need to download the video, convert it into the acceptable video format, upload it, and lastly post the directory code of the uploaded video onto your website.</h3></p>
